Hadoop Big Data Processing using MapReduce
📌 Project Title

Big Data Processing of Call Detail Records (CDR) using Hadoop & MapReduce

📝 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to process large-scale telecom Call Detail Records (CDR) using the Hadoop ecosystem, MapReduce (Shell Scripting), YARN, and HDFS.
It is a complete end-to-end big data assignment based on real-world telecom analytics.

The dataset contains details such as:

Caller ID

Receiver ID

Call Type (Local/STD/ISD)

Call Duration

Location



Using Hadoop’s distributed processing, the project generates key telecom insights like:

Peak call usage hours

Total duration per customer

Top 10 customers

Call count by type

Average call duration by location (Bonus)

🎯 Business Objective

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. generates millions of CDRs every day.
Traditional systems cannot handle this volume efficiently.
This project shows how Hadoop can:

Store CDRs in HDFS

Process them using MapReduce

Execute distributed computation using YARN

Extract meaningful telecom usage insights
